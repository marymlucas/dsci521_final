    "## 3.1 Data Preprocessing\n",
    "We undertook various steps to prepare our data. These are outlined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning\n",
    "This was an iterative process that involved exploring the data, noting anomalies and removing them, and then exploring the data again, and therefore these steps were not completed in a sequential manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main cleaning measures were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- date confinements:  we noticed that the data was very sparse before 3/1/2020 and therefore decided to set that as the start date of our analysis. We settled on an even 24 months for analysis and therefore constrained our dataset to this time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "- anomalous data points:  we removed one data point for the state of Iowa where the adult ICU bed utilization (our main metric of interest) was reported as greater than 50.  Because utilization is a proportion measure, we expected to see utilization values between 0 and 1.  The majority of observations fell in this range. There were a few that were above 1 and even fewer above between 2 and 3.  We considered that given the nature of the pandemic and the extent to which hospitals were sometimes overrun, values of utilization above 1 would indicate that some ICUs were running over capacity and overflowing into other areas of the hospital, hence utilization > 1. Because we only saw a value higher than 3 only once in this data (Iows on 08/15/2020), we decided it was likely a clerical error and opted to remove this row from our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "After an initial data exploration phase, we selected 35 variables out of the 117 to retain for our analysis. This selection was made based on examination of variable collinearity and domain knowledge. We noticed that many of the highly correlated variables were also derived from each other. For example there were features defined as \"numerator\" and \"denominator\" which were not relevant to our analysis. Our goal was to analyze impact of hospital capacity and state-wide burden, therefore many features examining covid diagnosis (suspected and confirmed) were dropped because they were not critical to our analysis. In addition, many features were focused on pediatric measures that were not applicable to our analysis, considering our ultimate target variable for icu bed utilization. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining and Calculating Under-Reporting\n",
    "To make our analysis meaningful, we decided to remove states that had high levels of underreporting.  For each metric in each row (day of data reported in the state), there is a corresponding \"coverage\" variable (denoted as *metric_coverage*). This coverage feature reports how many hospitals in the state submitted information about that metric on the day. For example, in the case of our main feaure of interest (adult_icu_bed_utilization), the *adult_icu_bed_utilization_coverage* feature gives an indication of how many hospitals in the state reported their adult icu bed utilization that day. \n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing the coverage with the number of hospitals in each state we were able to derive a simple measure of the level of reporting for each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most current list of hospital numbers was obtained from the Kaiser Family Foundation website (https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-hospitals) which reports data from the American Hospital Association (1999 - 2019) Annual Survey. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note the disclaimer that \"Data are for community hospitals, which represent 85% of all hospitals\" where community hospitals are defined as \"all nonfederal, short-term general, and specialty hospitals whose facilities and services are available to the public.\"  Because of this, we expected that for states with high reporting we may have instances of greater than 100% reporting, which we decided was acceptable for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In selecting a threshold, we considered the guidelines by the HHS for hospitals on how to report their numbers - https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-faqs-hospitals-hospital-laboratory-acute-care-facility-data-reporting.pdf. While this is a recent update, we noted that the changes from previous requirements did not affect the requirement to report or the frequency of reporting, only what fields are reported (https://healthdata.gov/stories/s/COVID-19-Reporting-and-FAQS/kjst-g9cm/). Based on this and on exploration of the data, we came up with a definition of under-reporting as \"greater than 25% of the hospitals not reporting acute_icu_bed_utilization.\"  After running our code, we the states of Rhode Island and New York, as they had the largest number of days of underreporting over the two year perion in our analysis.  In addition, after plotting a boxplot of total days reported per state, we noted that the US territories of Virgin Islands and American Samoa were outliers and had very low reporting days, so we dropped the territories from our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining and Calculating Burden\n",
    "We then calculated a burden metric for each state on each day.  To calculate burden, we used the criteria set by The US Department of Health and Human Services.  According to French et.al., (2021), “HHS has studied the relationship between hospital bed use and hospital strain and has identified occupancy >80% as an indicator of a strained condition. This analysis uses a continuous measure of ICU bed occupancy as a proxy for hospital strain, such that greater amounts of ICU bed use indicate larger amounts of hospital strain.” \n",
    "\n",
    "We determined from our survey of the relevant literature that 80% threshold is a good, validated metric for hospital strain that we could use as an indicator for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The burden metric is binary 1/0 value that is 1 if the adult icu bed utilization is greater than 0.8, and less otherwise. "

    "## 3.2 Analysis and Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Series Analysis - Simple Moving Average\n",
    "There are several factors that should be considered when performing a time series analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Stationarity: a time series model is said to be stationary if its statistical properties do not change over time. In other words, it has constant mean and variance, and covariance is independent of time. \n",
    "- Auto-correlation: this is the similarity between observations as a function of time given a lag of time between them. \n",
    "- Seasonality: a period fluctuation of observations over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, it is desirable to have a stationary time series for model. We can test for stationarity by performing a Dickey-Fuller test where the null hypothesis is that the series is not stationary (p > 0), and if p = 0 we then reject null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first model, the moving average, was the most naive. This model is simple in that it states that the next observation is the mean of all past observations in a given window. This model is typically a good starting point as we can identify interesting trends. In our analysis we hypothesized that our data is not stationary given that we observed the significant jump in ICU bed utilization around July 2020 (see animated choropleth).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression and Classification for Predicting Burden\n",
    ".... **ALICIA**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Series Forecasting for Predicting Trends in Utilization\n",
    "The goal here was to use standard forecasting methods to predict trends in ICU bed utilization during the pandemic. We chose to focus on Pennsylvania as this is our state of residence and where Drexel University is located. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data for PA was extracted and split into train and test subsets based on date, with the first 18 months (March 1, 2020 -  Sep 1, 2021) used as the training set and the last 6 months (Sep 1, 2021 - March 1, 2022) as the test set.  We then ran 3 different forecasting models on the data.  For simplicity, no adjustments, e.g. for stationarity, were made on either the training or the testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three models tested are described below:\n",
    "- Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) \n",
    "    - doesn’t capture seasonal trends. \n",
    "    - assumes that the time series data is stationary, meaning that its statistical properties wouldn’t change over time. \n",
    "- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)\n",
    "    - doesn’t assume stationarity \n",
    "    - assumes the data exhibits little to no seasonality\n",
    "- Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)\n",
    "    - is a variant of ARIMA \n",
    "    - can work with non-stationary data \n",
    "    - can capture some seasonality\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of each model was evaluated by calculating the root mean square error, and we also visualized the predicted trends compared to the actual trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disparity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "For the disparity analysis, we were limited in what measures of disparity we could meaningfully use given the varying granularity of our different datasets. For example, most income and race data is reported at a county level (for example by the Census bureau). But our utilization timeseries data is on a state level. Because the counties in each state have different socioeconomic levels, it's difficult to aggregate these measures and analyse disparity at a state level in a meaningful and actionable way. \n",
    "\n",
    "We mapped each several indicators of community wellness in choropleths as a way to assess disparity and to compare the differences between states with the animated choropleth of ICU burden.  The mapped indicators are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multidimensional Deprivation Index (MDI): This is a measure that was first reported by the CDC in 2019. It aims to measure \"how deprived people are in areas other than just income.\" ((Glassman (n.d)). The MDI is reported at the county level and is a continous variable with values between 0 and 1. For our analysis we modified it to a categorical variable with ten categories (\"< 0.1\", \"0.1 - 0.2\", ... \"0.9 - 1.0\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- Social Deprivation Index (SDI): This is another composite measure of seven demographic characteristics that are usually collected in the American Community Survey.  It mostly includes poverty measures such as percentage of people living in poverty, living in overcrowded conditions, not having a car, non-employed, etc. (see https://www.graham-center.org/maps-data-tools/social-deprivation-index.html)\n",
    "- COVID vulnerability Level:  \n",
    "\n",
    "We also analysed the population density of each state as an additional measure.\n",

    "In these first two choropleth plots we see that the multidimensional disparity index varies widely across counties and states and there is not really a clear correlation such that we could align MDI clearly with the trends in hospital burden that we see demonstrated in the animated heat map.  For example, most parts of the state of Texas appear to fall in 0.1 - 0.2 MDI range which we expected would correlate with low burden. However, Texas had sustained elevated levels of ICU utilization.  In contrast, most parts of Wyoming have MDI index < 0.1 and that would agree with the low hospital burden that we observed.  This indicates that the MDI in itself does not necessarily correlate with hospital burden in this instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The community vulnerability ranking choropleth on the right also does not appear to be very meaningful in understanding burden. We note that most parts of the country are denoted as \"ModerateBurden\". We to note some sustained hotspots in Florida, New York, and Michigan.  Most of Texas and Alabama, which in the data showed sustained high levels of burden appear in this map to have moderate burden. This discrepancy makes sense when we remember that this vulnerability data has not been updated since it was first collected, and additionally, we do not have a detailed understanding of how it was collected and the methodology behind the rankings. We did reach out to the data curators but did not receive a response. We therefore accept this as a limitation in using this dataset.\n",

    "In the SDI choropleth we note a clear pattern of high SDI in the southern states, California, and some of the states in the north east part of the country, including New York and Rhode Island.  Because we exluded New York and Rhode Island from our analysis due to underreporting, we're not able to compare and validate the relationship between burden and SDI for these two states. We do know though from extensive media reporting that New York was very heavily impacted by the pandemic during the first phase and therefore we can, anecdotally, infer that the high SDI may be correlated.  For the southern states like Texas, Alabama, Florida, and also for California, we see that they have a very high SDI compared to other parts of the country, and these states also showed high levels of burden in ICU utilization throughout the time duration of our study, as evidenced by the animated choropleth presented in the analysis.  This finding of correlation between SDI and hospital burden through visualization agrees with the results of the other models that found SDI had a correlation to hospital burden. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We included a population density analysis because we noticed in our animation that Wyoming had consistently low ICU burden throughout the duration of our study period, even though it did not compare more favourably in MDI or SDI when compared to the surrounding states. We speculated that population density may have played a role as low population density usually means low spread.  Our finding was that the states in the midwest part of the country that showed low utilization are also the ones with low population density. Likewise Florida, California, and New York and other east coast states with high population densities also demonstrated high burden. \n",

    "From this analysis we conclude that various factors may contribute to the disparate impact of the pandemic on different communities, and these include socioeconomic as well as geographic factors. \n"

    "## 5. Strengths and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "The strengths of this project lie in the amount of freely available data that we were able to harness and include in our analysis and modeling.  This shows that this kind of study can be extended and expanded on beyond our current work, and as the pandemic continues it can be easily updated and enhanced.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, this analysis is timely and of great relevance to various stakeholders both in looking back and looking forwards. Understanding how different communities were impacted and burdened by the COVID-19 pandemic and some of the underlying factors that caused the disparate impact, such as socioeconomic factors (as measured by the social deprivation index) and population density can help policy makers and communities to prepare more robustly for future health emergencies or other disasters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "We do have some limitations in our analysis and modelling that we would like to acknowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary limitation we faced, which has been alluded to in the disparity analysis section, is that we are using datasets that are provided at different granularity levels.  For example, the utilization data in our hospital time series data was at the state level while most of the disparity and social indicator data we could obtain was provided at the county level (apart from the SDI).  In future, it would be interesting to analyse timeseries information at the County level and then use Census data to, for example,  map socioeconomic indicatirs for the different counties. This would allow a more useful calculation and analysis of health disparities between groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second limitation is that we had to use data points from different data collection timeframes. While our ICU utilization data is very real time, the disparity and socioeconomic data is not, it's frozen at the collection time (2017 for the MDI data and 2018 for the SDI data). Additionally, the population density data is based on the 2020 census.  We are therefore making the assumption that these metrics have not varied much over the past few years.  We did find that even though the SDI data we used was from 2017 it was still very predictive of hospital burden."

    "## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal throughout this project was to come up with a model to understand the hospital burden throughout the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic and how socioeconomic disparities, and other metrics like population density may have impacted and continu to contribute to this burden.  We implemented multiple regression and time series models and were able to validate that social deprivation index and population density seemed to have a significant impact on how much hospital burden was experience din different states across the burden.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conclude that the best performing model for predicting hospital burden was the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model as it was able to predict correctly how ICU utilization would trend for the next six months. It also had the lowest root mean square error.  We hypothesize that we could use the ARMA model on a live dashboard that would update based on daily utilization data, keeping policy majers and public health administrators and other stakeholders updated and able to prepare for burden in their communities and to implement appropriate disaster management measures and clinical plans if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, from a health disparity perspective we conclude that the disparate impact of COVID-19 on hospital burden in different communities is multi-factorial but is certainly correlated with socioeconomic factors and population density. "
