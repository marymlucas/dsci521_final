Files Included:

Because of the amount of code used in our analysis and to generate visualizations for our work, we have divided our submission across two main notebooks and several other supplemental files. 


1. project.ipynb - Jupyter notebook containing the main written report with our motivating questions, description of the data, methods, results, and conclusions.  

2. project_code.ipynb -  Jupyter notebook containing all the code for our study.  Running this notebook should reproduce all our results

3. /data - this folder holds all the datasets used and referenced in our analysis.

4. /images - folder containing all the images produced and/or embedded in the report.

5. /misc - contains other supplemental information including a data dictionary describing the variables selected for our final analysis.
